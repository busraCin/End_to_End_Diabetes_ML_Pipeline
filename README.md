# Diabetes Dataset Project

This project is a study involving data analysis, preprocessing, model creation, and prediction stages on a diabetes dataset. Below are the project steps and instructions explained.

## Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Various analyses were conducted to understand the structure of the dataset. The `diabetes_research.py` file in the Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations and statistical information about the data.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
The dataset was cleaned through preprocessing steps, missing data was filled, and feature engineering was performed if necessary. These steps are detailed in the `diabetes_research.py` file.

## Step 3: Base Models
Basic models were created using different machine learning algorithms. The performance of these models was evaluated in the `diabetes_research.py` file.

## Step 4: Automated Hyperparameter Optimization
Using methods like Grid or Random Search, model hyperparameters were automatically tuned. This stage is demonstrated in the `diabetes_research.py` file.

## Step 5: Stacking & Ensemble Learning
Ensemble models were constructed by combining the results of different models. The implementation of these methods is explained in the `diabetes_research.py` file.

## Step 6: Prediction for a New Observation
After selecting the best model, the process of making predictions for a new observation is shown. This step is detailed in the `diabetes_research.py` file.

## Step 7: Pipeline Main Function
All steps were consolidated to create a main function that automates data loading, preprocessing, model creation, and prediction processes. The usage of this function is demonstrated in the `diabetes_pipeline.py` file.

## Step 8: Automation for Prediction - 'diabetes_prediction.py' 
To simplify and expedite the prediction process, I followed these steps:
1. First, I imported the `diabetes_pipeline.py` file located in the main directory of the project. This file encompasses the data preparation steps.
2. The `diabetes.csv` file was placed into the dataset folder named datasets.
Following these steps, I am now able to perform predictions quickly and effortlessly. This automation process streamlines the prediction process, enhancing the efficiency of the project.
